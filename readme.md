Ever wanted to write Processing sketches in Clojure? This is a quick-start project folder for the [Clooj](https://github.com/arthuredelstein/clooj) environment by Arthur Edelstein that contains the [clj-processing](https://github.com/rosado/clj-processing) library and requisite Processing libraries.

### Licensing
My understanding is that Processing's libraries (core.jar, gluegen-rt.jar, jogl.jar and opengl.jar) are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, so I'm including them here for ease of use.
